title: Execute Methods
---

Beside of standard W3C APIs the driver provides the below custom command extensions to execute platform specific scenarios. Use the following source code examples in order to invoke them from your client code:

```java
// Java 11+
var result = driver.executeScript("mobile: <methodName>", Map.ofEntries(
    Map.entry("arg1", "value1"),
    Map.entry("arg2", "value2")
    // you may add more pairs if needed or skip providing the map completely
    // if all arguments are defined as optional
));
```

```js
// WebdriverIO
const result = await driver.executeScript('mobile: <methodName>', [{
    arg1: "value1",
    arg2: "value2",
}]);
```

```python
# Python
result = driver.execute_script('mobile: <methodName>', {
    'arg1': 'value1',
    'arg2': 'value2',
})
```

```ruby
# Ruby
result = @driver.execute_script 'mobile: <methodName>', {
    arg1: 'value1',
    arg2: 'value2',
}
```

```csharp
// Dotnet
object result = driver.ExecuteScript("mobile: <methodName>", new Dictionary<string, object>() {
    {"arg1", "value1"},
    {"arg2", "value2"}
}));
```

### mobile: selectPickerWheelValue

Performs selection of the next or previous picker wheel value. This might
be useful if these values are populated dynamically, so you don't know which
one to select or value selection suing `sendKeys` API does not work because of an XCTest bug. The method throws an exception if it fails to change the current picker value.

#### Arguments

Name | Type | Required | Description | Example
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
elementId (`element` before version 1.22) | string | yes | PickerWheel's internal element id (as hexadecimal hash string) to perform value selection on. The element must be of type XCUIElementTypePickerWheel | abcdef12-1111-2222-3333-444444
order | string | yes | Either `next` to select the value next to the current one from the target picker wheel or `previous` to select the previous one. | next
offset | number | no | The value in range [0.01, 0.5]. It defines how far from picker wheel's center the click should happen. The actual distance is calculated by multiplying this value to the actual picker wheel height. Too small offset value may not change the picker wheel value and too high value may cause the wheel to switch two or more values at once. Usually the optimal value is located in range [0.15, 0.3]. `0.2` by default | 0.15
value | string | no | If provided WDA will try to automatically scroll in the given direction until the actual picker value reaches the expected one or the amount of scrolling attempts is exceeded. | myvalue
maxAttempts | number | no | The maximum number of scrolling attempts to reach `value` before an error will be thrown. Only makes sense in combination with `value`. 25 by default | 50

### mobile: alert

Tries to apply the given action to the currently visible alert.

#### Arguments

Name | Type | Required | Description | Example
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
action | string | yes | The actual action to apply. Could be either: `accept`, `dismiss` or `getButtons` | accept
buttonLabel | string | no | The name of the button used to perform the chosen alert action. Only makes sense if the action is `accept` or `dismiss` | Accept

#### Returned Result

The list of alert button names if the selected action is `getButtons`

### mobile: setPasteboard

Sets the Simulator's pasteboard content to the given value. Does not work for real devices.

#### Arguments

Name | Type | Required | Description | Example
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
content | string | yes | The content to set | hello
encoding | string | no | The content's encoding. `utf8` by default | ascii

### mobile: getPasteboard

Gets the Simulator's pasteboard content. Does not work for real devices.

#### Arguments

Name | Type | Required | Description | Example
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
encoding | string | no | The expected encoding of the returned string. `utf8` by default | ascii

#### Returned Result

The pasteboard content string.

### mobile: source

Allows to retrieve the source tree of the current page in different representation formats.

#### Arguments

Name | Type | Required | Description | Example
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
format | string | yes | One of possible page tree source representation formats: `xml` (the default value), `description` and `json`. The `xml` format generates the output similar to what `getPageSource` standard API returns. `description` representation is how XCTest "sees" the page internally and is the same string as [debugDescription](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xcuielement/1500909-debugdescription?language=objc) API would return for the root application element. This source representation format is useful for debugging purposes and is the fastest one to fetch. `json` representation is similar to `xml`, but the tree hierarchy there is represented as JSON elements tree rather than as XML nodes. | description
excludedAttributes | string | no | One or more comma-separated attribute names to be excluded from the XML output, thus only makes sense if `format` is set to `xml`. It might be sometimes helpful to exclude, for example, the `visible` attribute, to significantly speed-up page source retrieval. | visible,accessible

#### Returned Result

The page source tree formatted according to the given format argument.

### mobile: getContexts

Retrieves the list of available contexts including the extended context information, like urls and page names. This is different from the standard `getContexts` API, because the latter only has web view names without any additional information. In situation where multiple web views are available at once the client code would have to connect to each of them in order to detect the one, which needs to be interacted with. Although, this extra effort is not needed with the information provided by this extension.

#### Arguments

Name | Type | Required | Description | Example
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
waitForWebviewMs | number | no | Tells Appium for how long (in milliseconds) to wait for web view(s) to appear. `5000`ms by default | 10000

#### Returned Result

The list of available context objects along with their properties:

- id: The identifier of the context. The native context will be 'NATIVE_APP' and the webviews will be 'WEBVIEW_xxx'
- title: The title associated with the webview content. Could be `null`
- url: The url associated with the webview content. Could be `null`

### mobile: installApp

app | string | yes | See the description of the `appium:app` capability | /path/to/my.app
timeoutMs | number | no | The maximum time to wait until app install is finished in milliseconds on real devices. If not provided then the value of `appium:appPushTimeout` capability is used. If the capability is not provided then equals to 240000ms | 500000
strategy | string | no | One of possible app installation strategies on real devices. This argument is ignored on simulators. If not provided then the value of `appium:appInstallStrategy` is used. If the latter is also not provided then `serial` is used. See the description of `appium:appInstallStrategy` capability for more details on available values. | parallel

### mobile: listApps

List applications installed on the real device under test. This extension throws an error if called
for a Simulator device.
Offload applications will not be in the result.

#### Arguments

Name | Type | Required | Description | Example
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
applicationType | string | no | The type of applications to list. Either `System` or `User` (the default one) | System

#### Returned Result

A list of apps, where each item is a map where keys are bundle identifiers and values are maps of platform-specific app properties. Having `UIFileSharingEnabled` set to `true` in the app properties map means this app supports files upload and download into its `documents` container. Read [Pushing/Pulling files](https://appium.io/docs/en/writing-running-appium/ios/ios-xctest-file-movement/) for more details.

### mobile: clearApp

Deletes data files from the data container of an installed app,
so it could start from the clean state next time it is launched.
The destination app will be terminated if it is running when this API is invoked.
Sometimes it might also be necessary to invoke the following APIs
to fully reset the state of an installed app (make sure the app is not running while
calling them):
- [mobile: clearKeychains](#mobile-clearkeychains)
- [mobile: resetPermission](#mobile-resetpermission)

This API might not be 100% reliable for some apps. The only reliable method to fully
reset an existing app that Apple supports is to [uninstall](#mobile-removeapp) it and then perform a fresh [install](#mobile-installapp) of the same app.

This API only works on simulators. An exception is thrown if executed with real devices.

#### Arguments

Name | Type | Required | Description | Example
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
bundleId | string | yes | The bundle identifier of the application to be cleared | com.mycompany.myapp

#### Returned Result

`true` if at least one item has been successfully deleted from the app data container.

### mobile: startPerfRecord

Starts performance profiling for the device under test.
Relaxing security is mandatory for simulators. It can always work for real devices.
Since XCode 12 the method tries to use `xctrace` tool to record performance stats.
The `instruments` developer utility is used as a fallback for this purpose if `xctrace` is not available. It is possible to record multiple profiles at the same time. Read [Instruments User Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/InstrumentsUserGuide/Recording,Pausing,andStoppingTraces.html) for more details.
If the recording for the given profile is already running then nothing is done.

#### Arguments

Name | Type | Required | Description | Example
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
timeout | number | no | The maximum count of milliseconds to record the profiling information. It is recommended to always limit the maximum duration of perf record operation, since the resulting logs are pretty huge and may easily exceed the free space on th local storage volume. `300000`ms by default (5 minutes) | `600000`
profileName | string | no | The name of existing performance profile to apply. Can also contain the full path to the chosen template on the server file system. Note, that not all profiles are supported on mobile devices. `Activity Monitor` by default. | `Time Profile`
pid | string or number | no | The ID of the process to measure the performance for. Set it to `current` in order to measure the performance of the process, which belongs to the currently active application. All processes running on the device are measured if pid is unset (the default setting). | current

### mobile: stopPerfRecord

Stops the performance recording operation previosuly started by `mobile: startPerfRecord` call. If the previous call has already been completed due to the timeout then its result is returned immediately. An error is thrown if the performance recording has failed to start and recorded no data.

#### Arguments

Name | Type | Required | Description | Example
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
profileName | string | no | The name of existing performance profile to stop the recording for. Multiple recorders for different profile names could be executed at the same time. `Activity Monitor` by default. | `Time Profile`
remotePath | string | no | The path to the remote location, where the resulting zipped .trace file should be uploaded. The following protocols are supported: http/https, ftp Null or empty string value (the default setting) means the content of resulting file should be zipped, encoded as Base64 and passed as the endpoint response value. An exception will be thrown if the generated file is too big to fit into the available process memory. | https://myserver/upload
user | string | no | The name of the user for the remote authentication. Only works if `remotePath` is provided. | myuser
pass | string | no | The password for the remote authentication. Only works if `remotePath` is provided. | mypassword
method | string | no | The http multipart upload method name. Only works if `remotePath` is provided. `PUT` by default | POST
headers | dict | no | Additional headers mapping for multipart http(s) uploads | {'User-Agent': 'Myserver 1.0'}
fileFieldName | string | no | The name of the form field, where the file content BLOB should be stored for http(s) uploads. `file` by default | payload
formFields | dict or array | no | Additional form fields for multipart http(s) uploads | {'field2': 'value2'}

#### Returned Result

The resulting file in .trace format can be either returned directly as base64-encoded zip archive or uploaded to a remote location (such files could be pretty large), depending on the `remotePath` argument value. Afterwards it is possible to unarchive and open such file with Xcode Developer Tools.

### mobile: installCertificate

Installs a custom certificate onto the device. Since Xcode SDK 11.4 Apple has added a dedicated simctl subcommand to quickly handle certificates on Simulator over CLI.
On real devices the certificate could be installed via CLI if [py-ios-device](https://github.com/YueChen-C/py-ios-device) tool is available on the server machine.
On simulators before Xcode 11.4 SDK Apple provides no official way to do it via the command line. In such case (and also as a fallback if CLI setup fails) this method tries to wrap the certificate into .mobileconfig format and then deploys the wrapped file to the internal HTTP server, so one can open it via mobile Safari. Then the algorithm goes through the profile installation procedure by clicking the necessary buttons using WebDriverAgent.

#### Arguments

Name | Type | Required | Description | Example
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
content | string | yes | Base64-encoded content of the public certificate in [PEM](https://knowledge.digicert.com/quovadis/ssl-certificates/ssl-general-topics/what-is-pem-format.html) format | a23234...
commonName | string | no | Common name of the certificate. If this is not set then the script will try to parse it from the given certificate content. | com.myorg
isRoot | boolean | no | This option defines where the certificate should be installed to: either Trusted Root Store (`true`, the default option) or the Keychain (`false`). On environments other than Xcode 11.4+ Simulator this option is ignored. | false

#### Returned Result

The content of the generated .mobileconfig file as base64-encoded string. This config might be useful for debugging purposes. If the certificate has been successfully set via CLI then nothing is returned.

### mobile: removeCertificate

Removes installed certificate for real devices only if [py-ios-device](https://github.com/YueChen-C/py-ios-device) tool is available on the server machine since driver version 4.19.2.

#### Arguments

Name | Type | Required | Description | Example
---  | --- | --- | --- | ---

            'PayloadVersion': 1
        }
    },
    'Status': 'Acknowledged'
}
```

### mobile: startLogsBroadcast

Starts iOS system logs broadcast websocket on the same host and port where Appium server is running at `/ws/session/:sessionId:/appium/syslog` endpoint. The method will return immediately if the web socket is already listening.
Each connected webcoket listener will receive syslog lines as soon as they are visible to Appium.

Currently running applications will stay unchanged. This means, for example, that the keyboard
should be hidden and shown again in order to observe the changed layout, and corresponding
apps must be restarted in order to observe their interface using the newly set locale/language.
Also this method might leave some system UI alerts untranslated.
Be careful while setting the actual arguments since their actual values are not strictly checked.
This could lead to an unexpected behavior if an incorrect/unsupported language or locale abbreviation is provided.

### mobile: viewportRect

Retrieves the viwport dimensions.
The viewport is the device's screen size with status bar size subtracted if the latter is present/visible.

#### Returned Result

The response looks like `{"value":{"left":0,"top":96,"width":828,"height":1696}}`.

`left` and `top` are distance from the `left` of the screen and the `top` of the screen. [iOS Drawing Concepts](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/2DDrawing/Conceptual/DrawingPrintingiOS/GraphicsDrawingOverview/GraphicsDrawingOverview.html) could help about the relationship of coordinate.

`width` and `height` are the screen's width and height.

The response looks like `{"value":{"statusBarSize":{"width":414,"height":48},"scale":2}}`

`statusBarSize` contains status bar dimensions. It is the result of [status bar](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xcuielementtypequeryprovider/1500428-statusbars).
`scale` is [screen scale](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscreen/1617836-scale).

### mobile: swipe

This gesture performs a simple "swipe" gesture on the particular screen element or
on the application element, which is usually the whole screen. This method does not
accept coordinates and simply emulates single swipe with one finger. It might be
useful for such cases like album pagination, switching views, etc. More advanced
cases may require to call [mobile: dragFromToForDuration](#mobile-dragfromtoforduration),
where one can supply coordinates and duration.

#### Arguments

Name | Type | Required | Description | Example
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
elementId ("element" prior to Appium v 1.22) | string | no | The internal element identifier (as hexadecimal hash string) to swipe on. Application element will be used instead if this argument is not provided | fe50b60b-916d-420b-8728-ee2072ec53eb
direction | Either 'up', 'down', 'left' or 'right' | yes | The direction in which to swipe | up
velocity | number | no | This argument is optional and is only supported since Appium server version 1.19 and Xcode SDK version 11.4+. The value is measured in pixels per second and same values could behave differently on different devices depending on their display density. Higher values make swipe gesture faster (which usually scrolls larger areas if we apply it to a list) and lower values slow it down. Only values greater than zero have effect. | 250

#### Examples

```java
// Java
JavascriptExecutor js = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;
Map<String, Object> params = new HashMap<>();
params.put("direction", "down");
params.put("velocity", 2500);
params.put("element", ((RemoteWebElement) element).getId());
js.executeScript("mobile: swipe", params);
```

### mobile: scroll

Scrolls the element or the whole screen. Different scrolling strategies are supported.
Arguments define the choosen strategy: either 'name', 'direction', 'predicateString' or
'toVisible' in that order. All strategies are exclusive and only one strategy
can be applied at a single moment of time. Use "mobile: scroll" to emulate precise
scrolling in tables or collection views, where it is already known to which element
the scrolling should be performed. Although, there is one known limitation there: in case
it is necessary to perform too many scroll gestures on parent container to reach the
necessary child element (tens of them) then the method call may fail.
_Important_: The implemntation of this extension relies on several undocumented XCTest features, which might not always be reliable. Thus it might *not* always work as expected.

#### Arguments

Name | Type | Required | Description | Example
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
elementId ("element" prior to Appium v 1.22) | string | no | The internal element identifier (as hexadecimal hash string) to scroll on (e.g. the container). Application element will be used if this argument is not set | fe50b60b-916d-420b-8728-ee2072ec53eb
name | string | no | The accessibility id of the child element, to which scrolling is performed. The same result can be achieved by setting _predicateString_ argument to 'name == accessibilityId'. Has no effect if _elementId_ is not a container | cell12
direction | Either 'up', 'down', 'left' or 'right' | yes | The main difference from [swipe](#mobile-swipe) call with the same argument is that _scroll_ will try to move the current viewport exactly to the next/previous page (the term "page" means the content, which fits into a single device screen) | down
predicateString | string | no | The NSPredicate locator of the child element, to which the scrolling should be performed. Has no effect if _elementId_ is not a container | label == "foo"
toVisible | boolean | no | If set to _true_ then asks to scroll to the first visible _elementId_ in the parent container. Has no effect if _elementId_ is not set | true

#### Examples

```python
# Python
driver.execute_script('mobile: scroll', {'direction': 'down'});
```

### mobile: forcePress

Emulates force press on the given element/coordinates.
An error is thrown if the target device does not support force press gesture.

#### Arguments

Name | Type | Required | Description | Example
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
elementId | string | no | The internal element identifier (as hexadecimal hash string) to perform one or more taps. It is expected that both x and y are provided if this argument is ommitted. If the element identifier is provided without coordinates then the actual element's touch point will be calculated automatically by WebDriverAgent. | fe50b60b-916d-420b-8728-ee2072ec53eb
x | number | no | x coordinate of the gesture. It is calculated relatively to the given element (if provided). Otherwise the gesture destination point is calculated relatively to the active application. | 100
y | number | no | y coordinate of the gesture. It is calculated relatively to the given element (if provided). Otherwise the gesture destination point is calculated relatively to the active application | 100
duration | number | no | The float number of seconds the force press action would take. If duration is provided then it is also expected that a custom pressure value is provided as well. `0.5` by default. | 2.5
pressure | number | no | The float number defining how much pressure to apply. If pressure is provided then it is also expected that a custom duration value is provided as well. `1.0` by default | 1.5

### mobile: scrollToElement

Scrolls the current viewport to the given element. It is expected the destination element is inside a scrollable container and is hittable. The scroll direction is detected automatically.
This API uses native XCTest calls, so it performs scrolling pretty fast. The same native call is
implicitly performed by a vanilla `click` API if the destination element is out of the current viewport. An exception is thrown if the scrolling action cannot be performed.
This extension is available since the driver version 4.7.0.

#### Arguments

Name | Type | Required | Description | Example
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
elementId | string | yes | The internal element identifier (as hexadecimal hash string) to scroll to. The destination element must be located in a scrollable container and must be hittable. If the element is already present in the current viewport then no action is performed. | fe50b60b-916d-420b-8728-ee2072ec53eb

### mobile: resetLocationService

Reset the location service on real device since Appium 1.22.0.
It could delay a few seconds to reflect the location by the system.
It raises an error if the device is simulator or an error occurred during the reset.

### mobile: enableConditionInducer

Important: Device conditions are available for real devices running iOS 13.0 and later.

This API is going to throw an error if it is called while another condition inducer has been already enabled and is not explicitly disabled.

```
mobile: enableConditionInducer
mobile: disableConditionInducer
mobile: listConditionInducers
```

The above three extensions are available since the driver version 4.9.0.

You can create a condition on a connected device to test your app under adverse conditions, such as poor network connectivity or thermal constraints.

When you start a device condition, the operating system on the device behaves as if its environment has changed. The device condition remains active until you stop the device condition or disconnect the device. For example, you can start a device condition, run your app, monitor your app’s energy usage, and then stop the condition.

Reference: [Test under adverse device conditions (iOS)](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev308429d42)

Name | Type | Required | Description | Example
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
conditionID | string | yes | Get the conditionID parameter through the command `mobile: availableConditionInducer`   | SlowNetworkCondition
profileID | string | yes | Get the profileID parameter through the command `mobile: availableConditionInducer`     | SlowNetwork100PctLoss

#### Returned Result

Either `true` or `false`, where `true` means enabling of the condition inducer has been successful

### mobile: listConditionInducers

Get all condition inducer configuration profiles

#### Returned Result

The response looks like

```
[{
    "profiles": [
        {
            "name": "100% packet loss",
            "identifier": "SlowNetwork100PctLoss",   // enableConditionInducer profileID

    "isDestructive": false,
    "isInternal": false,
    "activeProfile": "",
    "name": "Network Link",
    "isActive": false
}]
```

### mobile: disableConditionInducer

Disable device condition inducer.

Usually a persistent connection is maintained after enable the condition inducer, and this method is only valid for this connection.

If the connection is disconnected, condition inducer will be automatically disabled

#### Returned Result

Either `true` or `false`, where `true` means disabling of the condition inducer has been successful

### mobile: calibrateWebToRealCoordinatesTranslation

Calibrates web to real coordinates translation.
This API can only be called from Safari web context.
It must load a custom page to the browser, and then restore
the original one, so don't call it if you can potentially
lose the current web app state.
The outcome of this API is then used if `nativeWebTap` capability/setting is enabled.
The returned value could also be used to manually transform web coordinates
to real device ones in client scripts.

It is adviced to call this API at least once before changing the device orientation
or device screen layout as the recetly received value is cached for the session lifetime
and may become obsolete.

It is advised to enable `nativeWebTapStrict` capability/setting to speed up dynamic coordinates
transformation if you use this extension.

#### Returned Result

An object with three properties used to properly shift Safari web element coordinates into native context:
- `offsetX`: Webview X offset in real coordinates
- `offsetY`: Webview Y offset in real coordinates
- `pixelRatioX`: Webview X pixel ratio
- `pixelRatioY`: Webview Y pixel ratio

The following formulas are used for coordinates translation:
`RealX = offsetX + webviewX * pixelRatioX`
`RealY = offsetY + webviewY * pixelRatioY`
