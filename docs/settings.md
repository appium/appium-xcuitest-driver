XCUITest driver supports Appium [Settings API](https://appium.io/docs/en/latest/guides/settings/).
Along with the common settings the following driver-specific settings are currently available:

Name | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
elementResponseAttributes | string | Comma-separated list of element attribute names to be included into findElement response. By default only element UUID is present there, but it is also possible to add the following items: `name`, `text`, `rect`, `enabled`, `displayed`, `selected`, `attribute/<element_attribute_name>`. It is required that `shouldUseCompactResponses` setting is set to `false` in order for this one to apply.
shouldUseCompactResponses | boolean | Used in combination with `elementResponseAttributes` setting. If set to `false` then the findElement response is going to include the items enumerated in `elementResponseAttributes` setting. `true` by default
screenshotQuality | int | See the description of the corresponding capability.
mjpegServerFramerate | int | The maximum count of screenshots per second taken by the MJPEG screenshots broadcaster. Must be in range 1..60. `10` by default
mjpegScalingFactor | int | The percentage value used to apply downscaling on the screenshots generated by the MJPEG screenshots broadcaster. Must be in range 1..100. `100` is by default, which means that screenshots are not downscaled.
mjpegServerScreenshotQuality | int | The percentage value used to apply lossy JPEG compression on the screenshots generated by the MJPEG screenshots broadcaster. Must be in range 1..100. `25` is by default, which means that screenshots are compressed to the quarter of their original quality.
customSnapshotTimeout (snapshotTimeout before 1.19.1) | float | Set how much time in float seconds is allowed to resolve a single accessibility snapshot with custom attributes. _Snapshots_ are mainly used for page source generation, XML lookup and custom attributes retrieval (these are visibility and accessibility ones). It might be necessary to increase this value if the actual page source is very large and contains hundreds of UI elements. Defaults to 15 seconds. Since Appium 1.19.1 if this timeout expires and no custom snapshot could be made then WDA tries to calculate the missing attributes using its own algorithms, so setting this value to zero might speed up, for example, page source retrieval, but for the cost of preciseness of some element attributes.
waitForIdleTimeout | float | Has the same meaning as corresponding capability (see above)
animationCoolOffTimeout | float | The amount of time in float seconds to wait until the application under test does not have any active animations. This check is usually applied after each automation action that is supposed to change the state of the application under test, like `click` one, and blocks XCTest until the transition of the tested application to a new state completes or the cool off timeout occurs. The default value is `2` (seconds). Setting it to zero disables animation checks completely.
snapshotMaxDepth | int | Changes the value of maximum depth for traversing elements source tree. It may help to prevent out of memory or timeout errors while getting the elements source tree, but it might restrict the depth of source tree. Please consider restricting this value if you observed an error like _Timed out snapshotting com.apple.testmanagerd..._ message or _Cannot get 'xml' source of the current application_ in your Appium log since they are possibly timeout related. A part of elements source tree might be lost if the value was too small. Defaults to `50`
useFirstMatch | boolean | Enabling this setting makes single element lookups faster, but there is the known [problem](https://github.com/appium/appium/issues/10101) related to nested elements lookup. Defaults to `false`.
reduceMotion | boolean | Changes the 'reduce motion' preference of accessibility feature. Defaults to `false`
defaultActiveApplication | string | Sets the hint for active application selection. This helps WebDriverAgent to select the current application if there are multiple items in the active applications list and the desired one is also one of them. The setting is particularly useful for split-screen apps automation. Defaults to `auto`, which makes WebDriverAgent to select the application whose element is located at `screenPoint` location or a single item from the active apps list if the length of this list is equal to one.
activeAppDetectionPoint | string | Defines the coordinates of the current screen point. WebDriverAgent uses this point to detect the active application if multiple application are active on the screen. The format of this value is `x,y`, where x and y are float or integer numbers representing valid screen coordinates. Setting this value to a point outside the actual screen coordinates might corrupt WebDriverAgent functionality. By default the screen point coordinates equal to 20% of the minimum screen dimension each, e.g. `MIN(w, h) * 0.2, MIN(w, h) * 0.2`
includeNonModalElements | boolean | Whether returns all of elements including no modal dialogs on iOS 13+. It fixes [cannot find elements on nested modal presentations](https://github.com/appium/appium/issues/13227), but it might make visibility attributes unreliable. You could also enable `shouldUseTestManagerForVisibilityDetection` setting (defaults to `false`) or `simpleIsVisibleCheck` capability to improve the visibility detection. This issue may happen between iOS 13.0 to 13.2 (Xcode 11.0 to 11.2). The query issued in `includeNonModalElements` returns `nil` with newer iOS/Xcode versions and Appium/WDA return proper elements three without this setting being used. Defaults to `false`.
acceptAlertButtonSelector | string | Allows to customize accept alert button selector. It helps you to handle an arbitrary element as accept button in `accept alert` command. The selector should be a valid [class chain](https://github.com/facebookarchive/WebDriverAgent/wiki/Class-Chain-Queries-Construction-Rules) expression, where the search root is the alert element itself. The default button location algorithm is used if the provided selector is wrong or does not match any element. Example: ```**/XCUIElementTypeButton[`label CONTAINS[c] 'accept'`]```
dismissAlertButtonSelector | string | Allows to customize dismiss alert button selector. It helps you to handle an arbitrary element as dismiss button in `dismiss alert` command. The selector should be a valid [class chain](https://github.com/facebookarchive/WebDriverAgent/wiki/Class-Chain-Queries-Construction-Rules) expression, where the search root is the alert element itself. The default button location algorithm is used if the provided selector is wrong or does not match any element. Example: ```**/XCUIElementTypeButton[`label CONTAINS[c] 'dismiss'`]```
screenshotOrientation | string | Adjust screenshot orientation for iOS. Appium tries to return a screenshot and adjust its orientation properly using internal heuristics, but sometimes it does not work, especially in landscape mode. The actual screenshot orientation depends on various factors such as OS versions, model versions and whether this is a real or simulator device. This option allows you to enforce the given image orientation. Acceptable values: `auto` (default), `portrait`, `portraitUpsideDown`, `landscapeRight`, `landscapeLeft`.
boundElementsByIndex | boolean | Whether to look up elements with [`allElementsBoundByAccessibilityElement`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xcuielementquery/1500816-allelementsboundbyaccessibilitye) (default) or [`allElementsBoundByIndex`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xcuielementquery/1500945-allelementsboundbyindex). [This Stack Overflow topic](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49307513/meaning-of-allelementsboundbyaccessibilityelement) explains the differences. Defaults to `false`.
keyboardAutocorrection | boolean | Changes the 'Auto-Correction' preference in _Keyboards_ setting. Defaults to `false`.
keyboardPrediction | boolean | Changes the 'Predictive' preference in _Keyboards_ setting. Defaults to `false`.
nativeWebTap | boolean | See the description of the corresponding capability.
nativeWebTapStrict | boolean | See the description of the corresponding capability.
nativeWebTapTabBarVisibility | enum | Bypass finding whether the existence of the _**tab bar**_ before tapping on the element. It could make native web tap faster. If it's `visible`, tab bar offset will be added without checking the existence of the tab bar. It's `invisible`, the tab bar offset will be `zero`. If you want to leave Appium to check and measure the tab bar offset, unset or set `detect`. Only applicable if `nativeWebTap` and `nativeWebTapStrict` are enabled. Unset by default.
nativeWebTapSmartAppBannerVisibility | enum | The same as `nativeWebTapTabBarVisibility`, this keyword will bypass finding whether the existence of the _**smart app banner**_.
safariTabBarPosition | string | Handle offset of Safari tab bar in `nativeWebTap` enabled interactions. If `platformVersion` was greater than or equal to 15 and iPhone device, the value is `bottom` by default. Otherwise `top`. When the value is `top`, Appium considers offset as the bar length. iOS 15+ environment can customize the bar position in the settings app, so please adjust the offset with this. Acceptable values: `bottom`, `top`
useJSONSource | boolean | See the description of the corresponding capability.
pageSourceExcludedAttributes | string | One or more comma-separated attribute names to be excluded from the XML output. It might be sometimes helpful to exclude, for example, the `visible` attribute, to significantly speed-up page source retrieval. This does not affect the XML output when `useJSONSource` is enabled. Defaults to an empty string. Example: `"visible,accessible"`
