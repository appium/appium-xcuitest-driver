title: Run Prebuilt WebDriverAgentRunner
---

The XCUITest driver runs `xcodebuild` to build and install the WebDriverAgentRunner (WDA) app on the
target device. Running the command every time could slow down new session creation.
You can manually run a modified version of this command in order to prebuild the WDA.

## Understanding How `xcodebuild` Works

By default, `xcodebuild` is run with two commands: `build-for-testing` and `test-without-building`.
`build-for-testing` builds a test bundle package, whereas `test-without-building` actually runs it.

For instance, XCUITest driver issues an `xcodebuild` command like so:

```bash
xcodebuild build-for-testing test-without-building \
  -project WebDriverAgent.xcodeproj \
  -derivedDataPath wda_build \
  -scheme WebDriverAgentRunner \
  -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 14 Pro" \
  CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

This translates to `xcodebuild` building `WebDriverAgent.xcodeproj` and running the resulting
package on the specified device. The built package will be located in the `wda_build` path.

The command can be split into `build-for-testing` and `test-without-building` parts as follows:

```bash
xcodebuild build-for-testing \
  -project WebDriverAgent.xcodeproj \
  -derivedDataPath wda_build \
  -scheme WebDriverAgentRunner \
  -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 14 Pro" \
  CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

```bash
xcodebuild test-without-building \
  -xctestrun wda_build/Build/Products/WebDriverAgentRunner_iphonesimulator16.2-arm64.xctestrun \
  -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 14 Pro"
```

* The `build-for-testing` command generates two files: an `.app` package and an `.xctestrun` file, e.g.:

    ```
    wda_build/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/WebDriverAgentRunner-Runner.app
    wda_build/Build/Products/WebDriverAgentRunner_iphonesimulator16.2-arm64.xctestrun
    ```

    The `.xctestrun` file name depends on the `-destination` preference. The file contains metadata
    about the package (the `DependentProductPaths` key).

* The `test-without-building` command starts the WDA application for testing by referencing the
  provided `.xctestrun` file. Once this is done, `http://localhost:8100` will be able to receive
  commands for the target device.

## Preparation performance improvement ideas

### Download Prebuilt WDA and run them with `appium:prebuiltWDAPath` and `appium:usePreinstalledWDA`

This approach allows the XCUITest driver to start WDA without running `xcodebuild` by using prebuilt WDA packages.
We recommend this method if you don't need to modify the WDA source code.

[The Appium WebDriverAgent GitHub page](https://github.com/appium/WebDriverAgent/releases) provides
downloads for WebDriverAgent packages for real devices and simulators.
WebDriverAgent packages for real devices do not have embedded XCTest frameworks so that
they can run on iOS 17+ devices. Please read [Run Preinstalled WebDriverAgentRunner](./run-preinstalled-wda.md)
for more details about running on real devices. Understanding app signing is also important when working with real devices.
Simulators need everything, so WDA package sizes for simulators are greater than for real devices.
The [Release](https://github.com/appium/appium-xcuitest-driver/actions/workflows/publish.js.yml) and
[Building WebDriverAgent](https://github.com/appium/WebDriverAgent/actions/workflows/wda-package.yml)
workflows may help with validating the build script.

[Run Preinstalled WebDriverAgentRunner](./run-preinstalled-wda.md) provides `appium:prebuiltWDAPath`
and `appium:usePreinstalledWDA` capabilities.
These capabilities allow the XCUITest driver to install prebuilt WDA specified with
`appium:prebuiltWDAPath` and start it **without** running `xcodebuild`.

The `download-wda-sim` command helps to download the proper version of WDA for your XCUITest driver version
for simulator use.

```bash
appium driver run xcuitest download-wda-sim --outdir=/path/to/target/directory
```

Then, starting a new session with capabilities below:

```json
{
  "appium:usePreinstalledWDA": true,
  "appium:prebuiltWDAPath": "/path/to/target/directory/WebDriverAgentRunner-Runner.app"
}
```

The new session starts without an `xcodebuild` run.

### Capabilities for Prebuilt WDA with `appium:useXctestrunFile`, `appium:usePrebuiltWDA` or `appium:prebuildWDA`

The XCUITest driver provides two capabilities that allow skipping the `build-for-testing` command,
and executing only the `test-without-building` command: __`appium:useXctestrunFile`__ and
__`appium:bootstrapPath`__ (see [Capabilities](../reference/capabilities.md#webdriveragent)).

!!! note

    These capabilities expect that the WDA files are already prebuild, so make sure to first run
    `xcodebuild` to create the files.

This method can be used on both real devices and simulators, but real devices requires proper
signing as described in [Run Preinstalled WebDriverAgentRunner](./run-preinstalled-wda.md).

The capabilities can be used as follows:

```json
{
  "platformName": "ios",
  "appium:automationName": "xcuitest",
  "appium:platformVersion": "18.4",
  "appium:deviceName": "iPhone 16",
  "appium:useXctestrunFile": true,
  "appium:bootstrapPath": "/path/to/wda_build/Build/Products"
}
```

Not all combinations have been tested, but the target device can probably be anything.

The same thing can be achieved with the __`appium:derivedDataPath`__ and __`appium:usePrebuiltWDA`__
capabilities, but this may fail if `xcodebuild` cannot find or handle the `.xctestrun` file
properly. The stability depends on Xcode.

__`appium:prebuildWDA`__ lets the XCUITest driver build the WDA before running it, then the session
will be handled with `appium:usePrebuiltWDA`.
It might have additional building steps than with `appium:derivedDataPath` and `appium:usePrebuiltWDA`
combination, but it could help `appium:usePrebuiltWDA` to not manage the WDA project.
