title: Real Device Configuration
---

In order to communicate with the device under test, the XCUITest driver automatically installs the
`WebDriverAgentRunner-Runner` (WDA) application on it, using Xcode's command-line utility `xcodebuild`.
Unlike simulators, real devices have several security restrictions that need to be manually
configured, before this can work:

- Devices need to be trusted. This can be done by opening Xcode and afterwards physically connecting
  the device under test to the computer. The device should have a popup asking to trust the computer,
  which you should accept.
- Devices using iOS/iPadOS 16 or above require enabling Developer Mode. Please read
  [Apple's documentation on Developer Mode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/enabling-developer-mode-on-a-device)
  for more details. `devmodectl streaming` CLI on macOS 13+ and installing development signed apps
  also help enabling the mode.
- After enabling Developer Mode (if applicable), please turn on _Settings -> Developer -> Enable UI Automation_
- Webviews will not be testable unless the Safari Inspector is enabled. Please turn it on in
  _Settings -> Safari -> Advanced -> Web Inspector_. Similarly, you may want to turn on the adjacent
  option _Settings -> Safari -> Advanced -> Remote Automation_.

Finally, the WDA application must have a valid provisioning profile, which includes signing the app
and linking it to a development team.

## Provisioning Profile Setup

Generally, unless your device under test [already has WDA installed](../guides/run-preinstalled-wda.md),
or you already have [a prebuilt WDA](../guides/run-prebuilt-wda.md) on your local system, you will
need an Apple ID to be able to sign the app.

Once you have an Apple ID, there are several approaches you can take.

* [__Basic Automatic Configuration__](./prov-profile-basic-auto.md): the easiest approach, but
  requires you to have a paid Apple Developer account

If the automatic configuration did not work or does not apply to you, you will need to follow one of
the manual configuration approaches. All of these involve the WDA Xcode project, so at the very
least, you must know the local path to the project file - `WebDriverAgent.xcodeproj`:

* The WDA project is included in `appium-webdriveragent`, which is installed as a dependency of the
  XCUITest driver. You can therefore find the project file in
  `/path/to/xcuitest/driver/node_modules/appium-webdriveragent/WebDriverAgent.xcodeproj`.
  By default, drivers are installed in `~/.appium`, so the project would be located at
  `~/.appium/node_modules/appium-xcuitest-driver/node_modules/appium-webdriveragent/WebDriverAgent.xcodeproj`.
* If using XCUITest driver v4.13.0 or newer, you can run the `appium driver run xcuitest open-wda`
  [driver script](../reference/scripts.md) to directly open `WebDriverAgent.xcodeproj` in Xcode.

The WDA project file can now be used in the manual configuration approaches:

* [__Basic Manual Configuration__](./prov-profile-basic-manual.md): create a new project, then use
  its provisioning profile and bundle ID
* [__Full Manual Configuration__](./prov-profile-full-manual.md): associate the provisioning profile
  directly with the WDA project
* [__Manual Configuration for a Generic Device__](./prov-profile-generic-manual.md): manually run
  `xcodebuild` to build WDA, then manually install it

### Validating the WDA Install

Once you have configured the WDA project or have the app ready, you can try installing it. It is
possible that you may encounter some errors:

* `xcodebuild exited with code '65' and signal 'null'`

    This usually happens when attempting the automatic configuration, and it means that the necessary
    code signing is not set up correctly. Follow the steps in any of the manual configuration
    approaches to fix this.

* `Unable to launch <your-bundle-id>.WebDriverAgentRunner-Runner because it has an invalid code
  signature, inadequate entitlements or its profile has not been explicitly trusted by the user.`

    This means that the developer is not trusted on the device. If you manually try to open the WDA
    app on the device, you will see a popup message:

    ![Untrusted developer](./assets/images/untrusted-dev.png)

    To fix this, you need to open _Settings -> General -> VPN & Device Management_ on the device, then
    select your development team and trust it. Afterwards you should be able to open/launch the app.
    See [Apple documentation for more information](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204460).

### Create an Offline Provisioning Profile

Since iOS 16, Apple requires a device to have a live internet connection for validating the code
signing. It is possible to set up an offline enabled provisiong profile, which allows you to avoid
the limitation. Please read [this issue](https://github.com/appium/appium/issues/18378#issuecomment-1482678074)
regarding detailed configuration steps.

## Tune WebDriverAgent to improve session startup performance

Running `xcodebuild` every time takes much longer time to complete a session startup.
XCUITest driver offers a few methods to improve the performance with, or without using `xcodebuild`.

Some might require deeper understanding of iOS development environment,
but they help to improve speedup your test execution speed.
