## External dependencies

In addition to the git submodules mentioned above, this package currently depends
on `libimobiledevice` to do certain things. Install it with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/),

```
brew install ideviceinstaller
```

There is also a dependency, made necessary by Facebook's [WebDriverAgent](https://github.com/facebook/WebDriverAgent),
for the [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) dependency manager. If you
do not have Carthage on your system, it can also be installed with
[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)

```
brew install carthage
```

`ideviceinstaller` doesn't work with iOS 10 yet. So we need to install [ios-deploy](https://github.com/phonegap/ios-deploy)

```
npm install -g ios-deploy
```

On some systems the default logger, `idevicesyslog`, does not work. You can install `deviceconsole` and specify its path with the `realDeviceLogger` capability
(**note:** This path should be the path to the _executable_ installed by the below command. It will be the directory created by the below command, followed by
`/deviceconsole`).

```
npm install -g deviceconsole
```

For real devices we can use [xcpretty](https://github.com/supermarin/xcpretty) to make Xcode output more reasonable. This can be installed by

```
gem install xcpretty
```


## Sim Resetting

By default, this driver will create a new iOS simulator and run tests on it, deleting the simulator afterward.

If you specify a specific simulator using the `udid` capability, this driver will boot the specified simulator and shut it down afterwards.

If a udid is provided and the simulator is already running, this driver will leave it running after the test run.

In short, this driver tries to leave things as it found them.

You can use the `noReset` capability to adjust this behavior.
Setting `noReset` to `true` will leave the simulator running at the end of a test session.


## Real devices

### Configuration

The `appium-xcuitest-driver` has provisional support for iOS real devices. Not all functionality is currently supported.

WebDriverAgent needs to be built with `development team` and `provisioning profile` installed on device. The easiest way
to do this is to specify them in an xcconfig file, the path to which is passed in to the system using the
`xcodeConfigFile` desired capability
```
DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = <Team ID>
CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY = iPhone Developer

```
The Team ID is a unique 10-character string generated by Apple that is assigned to your team. You can find your Team ID using your developer account (Sign in to [developer.apple.com/account](developer.apple.com/account), and click Membership in the sidebar. Your Team ID appears in the Membership Information section under the team name.).

### Manual configuration alternative

Alternatively, the profile can be manually associated with the project (keep in mind that this will have to be done each
time the WebDriverAgent is updated):

* Open terminal go to `node_modules/appium-xcuitest-driver/WebDriverAgent` (this path is relative to your appium installation).
    ```
    mkdir -p Resources/WebDriverAgent.bundle
    sh ./Scripts/bootstrap.sh -d
  ```

* Open `WebDriverAgent.xcodeproj` in Xcode. Select your `development team` for **both** the `WebDriverAgentLib` and `WebDriverAgentRunner`
targets. This should also auto select `Signing Ceritificate`. The outcome should look as shown below.

  ![alt WebDriverAgent in Xcode project](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12143988/18771980/2dc4f412-80f8-11e6-9ad6-c6883dbf6a03.png)

* Build `WebDriverAgent` once to verify all above steps worked.
  ```
    xcodebuild -project WebDriverAgent.xcodeproj -scheme WebDriverAgentRunner -destination 'id=<udid>' test

  ```
  Last line on build output above command should be `Listening on USB`. Then you are all set!

  Internally it also expects `idevicesyslog` to be installed. For iOS 10 you need to install it like this `brew install libimobiledevice --HEAD` and for iOS 9 `brew install libimobiledevice`

### Known problems

#### Logger not working

If the system stops with log output like

```
[XCUITest] Waiting for WebDriverAgent to start on device
[debug] [XCUITest] Log file for xcodebuild test: /Users/user/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/WebDriverAgent-dmeyhiwwsjtvnpfsgvqwxasavdxs/Logs/Test/23E16C13-3EFF-4980-95BD-8F69A04D91E3/Session-WebDriverAgentRunner-2016-10-07_095258-KgtUwt.log
```

The culprit is usually the real device logger. By default the system uses `idevicesyslog`, which is installed with `libimobiledevice`, but on some machines this does not work. You can test by running `idevicesyslog` in a terminal window. If it fails, you can use `deviceconsole`, specifying the full path to the program with the `realDeviceLogger` capability.

#### Weird state

**Note:** Running WebDriverAgent tests on a real device is particularly flakey. If things stop responding, the only recourse is, most often, to restart the device. Logs in the form of the following _may_ start to occur:

```shell
info JSONWP Proxy Proxying [POST /session] to [POST http://10.35.4.122:8100/session] with body: {"desiredCapabilities":{"ap..."
dbug WebDriverAgent Device: Jul 26 13:20:42 iamPhone XCTRunner[240] <Warning>: Listening on USB

dbug WebDriverAgent Device: Jul 26 13:22:57 iamPhone XCTRunner[240] <Warning>: Enqueue Failure: UI Testing Failure - App state of (null) is still unknown <unknown> 0 1
```

### Real device security settings

On some systems there are Accessibility restrictions that make the `WebDriverAgent` system unable to run. This is usually manifest
by `xcodebuild` returning an error code `65`. A workaround for this is to use a private key that is not stored on the system
keychain. See [this issue](https://github.com/appium/appium/issues/6955) and [this Stack Exchange post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16550594/jenkins-xcode-build-works-codesign-fails).

To export the key, use

```
security create-keychain -p [keychain_password] MyKeychain.keychain
security import MyPrivateKey.p12 -t agg -k MyKeychain.keychain -P [p12_Password] -A
```

where `MyPrivateKey.p12` is the private development key exported from the system keychain.

The full path to the keychain can then be sent to the Appium system using the `keychainPath` desired capability,
and the password sent through the `keychainPassword` capability.

## Desired Capabilities

Should be the same for [Appium](https://github.com/appium/appium/blob/master/docs/en/writing-running-appium/caps.md)

Differences noted here

|Capability|Description|Values|
|----------|-----------|------|
|`noReset`|Do not destroy or shut down sim after test. Start tests running on whichever sim is running, or device is plugged in. Default `false`|`true`, `false`|
|`processArguments`|Process arguments and environment which will be sent to the WebDriverAgent server.|`{ args: ["a", "b", "c"] , env: { "a": "b", "c": "d" } }` or `'{"args": ["a", "b", "c"], "env": { "a": "b", "c": "d" }}'`|
|`wdaLocalPort`|This value if specified, will be used to forward traffic from Mac host to real ios devices over USB. Default value is same as port number used by WDA on device.|e.g., `8100`|
|`showXcodeLog`|Whether to display the output of the Xcode command used to run the tests. If this is `true`, there will be **lots** of extra logging at startup. Defaults to `false`|e.g., `true`|
|`realDeviceLogger`|Device logger for real devices. It could be path to `deviceconsole` (installed with `npm install deviceconsole`, a compiled binary named `deviceconsole` will be added to `./node_modules/deviceconsole/`) or `idevicesyslog` (comes with libimobiledevice). Defaults to `idevicesyslog`|`idevicesyslog`, `/abs/path/to/deviceconsole`|
|`iosInstallPause`|Time in milliseconds to pause between installing the application and starting WebDriverAgent on the device. Used particularly for larger applications. Defaults to `0`|e.g., `8000`|
|`xcodeConfigFile`|Full path to an optional Xcode configuration file that specifies the code signing identity and team for running the WebDriverAgent on the real device.|e.g., `/path/to/myconfig.xcconfig`|
|`keychainPath`|Full path to the private development key exported from the system keychain. Used in conjunction with `keychainPassword` when testing on real devices.|e.g., `/path/to/MyPrivateKey.p12`|
|`keychainPassword`|Password for unlocking keychain specified in `keychainPath`.|e.g., `super awesome password`|



## Development

This project has git submodules!

Clone with the `git clone --recursive` flag. Or, after cloning normally run `git submodule init` and then `git submodule update`

The `git diff --submodule` flag is useful here. It can also be set as the default `diff` format: `git config --global diff.submodule log`

`git config status.submodulesummary 1` is also useful.


### Watch

```
npm run watch
```


### Test

```
npm test
```


### WebDriverAgent Updating

Updating FaceBook's [WebDriverAgent](https://github.com/facebook/WebDriverAgent)
is as simple as running updating the submodule and then committing the change:

```
git checkout -b <update-branch-name>
git submodule update --remote
git add WebDriverAgent
git commit -m "Updating upstream WebDriverAgent changes"
```

There is a chance that the update changed something critical, which will manifest
itself as `xcodebuild` throwing errors. The easiest remedy is to delete the
files, which are somewhere like `/Users/isaac/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/WebDriverAgent-eoyoecqmiqfeodgstkwbxkfyagll`.
This is also necessary when switching SDKs (e.g., moving from Xcode 7.3 to 8).
