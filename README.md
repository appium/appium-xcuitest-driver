This project has git submodules!

Clone with the `git clone --recursive` flag. Or, after cloning normally run `git submodule init` and then `git submodule update`

The `git diff --submodule` flag is useful here. It can also be set as the default `diff` format: `git config --global diff.submodule log`

`git config status.submodulesummary 1` is also useful.


## External dependencies

In addition to the git submodules mentioned above, this package currently depends
on `libimobiledevice` to do certain things. Install it with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/),

```
brew install ideviceinstaller
```

There is also a dependency, made necessary by Facebook's [WebDriverAgent](https://github.com/facebook/WebDriverAgent),
for the [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) dependency manager. If you
do not have Carthage on your system, it can also be installed with
[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)

```
brew install carthage
```
ideviceinstaller doesn't work with ios 10 yet. So we need to install [ios-deploy]()(https://github.com/phonegap/ios-deploy)

```
npm install -g ios-deploy
```

## Sim Resetting

By default, this driver will create a new iOS simulator and run tests on it, deleting the simulator afterward.

If you specify a specific simulator using the `udid` capability, this driver will boot the specified simulator and shut it down afterwards.

If a udid is provided and the simulator is already running, this driver will leave it running after the test run.

In short, this driver tries to leave things as it found them.

You can use the `noReset` capability to adjust this behavior.
Setting `noReset` to `true` will leave the simulator running at the end of a test session.

## Real devices

The `appium-xcuitest-driver` has provisional support for iOS real devices. Not all functionality is currently supported.

The main issue with testing on real devices is that the app under test must be built with the same provisioning profile as the WebDriverAgent is built. At the moment, the command being used to build the WebDriver agent is (with adjustments for paths):

```
xcodebuild \
  -project' <path-to-WebDriverAgent>/WebDriverAgent.xcodeproj \
  -scheme WebDriverAgentRunner \
  -sdk iphoneos \
  -destination platform=iOS,id=<UDID> \
  CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY=iPhone Developer \
  CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=YES \
  test
```

Therefore it is recommended that the app under test be built with the same command, making sure it is built for the same device and, also importantly, for debugging:

```
xcodebuild \
  -project ./<APP>.xcodeproj \
  -sdk iphoneos \
  -destination platform=iOS,id=<UDID> \
  CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY='iPhone Developer' \
  CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=YES \
  -configuration Debug \
  clean build
```

Internally it also expects `idevicesyslog` to be installed (see installation instructions for [libimobiledevice](http://www.libimobiledevice.org/)).

**Note:** Running WebDriverAgent tests on a real device is particularly flakey. If things stop responding, the only recourse is, most often, to restart the device. Logs in the form of the following _may_ start to occur:

```shell

## Usage

Desired Capabilities:

Should be the same for [Appium](https://github.com/appium/appium/blob/master/docs/en/writing-running-appium/caps.md)

Differences noted here

|Capability|Description|Values|
|----------|-----------|------|
|`noReset`|Do not destroy or shut down sim after test. Start tests running on whichever sim is running, or device is plugged in. Default `false`|`true`, `false`|
|`processArguments`|Process arguments and environment which will be sent to the WebDriverAgent server.|`{ args: ["a", "b", "c"] , env: { "a": "b", "c": "d" } }` or `'{"args": ["a", "b", "c"], "env": { "a": "b", "c": "d" }}'`|
|`wdaLocalPort`|This value if specified, will be used to forward traffic from Mac host to real ios devices over USB. Default value is same as port number used by WDA on device.|e.g., `8100`|
|`showXcodeLog`|Whether to display the output of the Xcode command used to run the tests. If this is `true`, there will be **lots** of extra logging at startup. Defaults to `false`|e.g., `true`|
|`realDeviceLogger`|Device logger for real devices. It could be path to `deviceconsole` (You can install `npm install deviceconsole`.A compiled binary named `deviceconsole` will be added to `./node_modules/deviceconsole/`.) or `idevicesyslog` (This comes with libimobiledevice)|`idevicesyslog`, `/abs/path/to/deviceconsole`|

## Watch

## WebDriverAgent Updating

Updating FaceBook's [WebDriverAgent](https://github.com/facebook/WebDriverAgent)
is as simple as running updating the submodule and then committing the change:

```
git checkout -b <update-branch-name>
git submodule update --remote
git add WebDriverAgent
git commit -m "Updating upstream WebDriverAgent changes"
```

There is a chance that the update changed something critical, which will manifest
itself as `xcodebuild` throwing errors. The easiest remedy is to delete the
files, which are somewhere like `/Users/isaac/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/WebDriverAgent-eoyoecqmiqfeodgstkwbxkfyagll`.
This is also necessary when switching SDKs (e.g., moving from Xcode 7.3 to 8).
